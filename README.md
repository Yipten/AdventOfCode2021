# Advent Of Code 2021

This is my code for the 2021 Christmas season programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). 

I decided to use Python so I could use this as an opportunity to learn the language better. Because of this, the quality of my code may not be the best, but should hopefully improve a little with each puzzle.
